# Teaching Quantum Computing

## QEVEC RSEs Tutorial

### Instructions

To run the tutorial you will need the following:
- install conda on your computer (<a href='https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html'>instructions here</a>)
- clone or download this repository (green code button above)
- crete the environment by using the following command: conda env create -f qc_tutorial.yml (the qc_tutorial.yml file is contained in this repository)
- get <a href="https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/signup/">access to the D-Wave quantum annealers</a>. D-Wave gives a free one off 1 minute access to their machines upon registration. If you create a Developer account by linking your GitHub account you get 1 min/month for free (if you don't have a GitHub account no worries, it is free and quick to get). Instructions about configuring access can be found <a href="https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/overview/sapi.html">here</a>. The tutorial can be used to generate QUBO/Ising models without having access to the actual anenaler.
- launch the QEVEC_RSE_tutorial.ipynb Jupyter Notebook
- Have fun!
